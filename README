project structure:
    opencl-editor: OpenCL editor
    jocl-runtime: library wrapper module packaging JOCL
    jocl-project: provides the "New OpenCL Project" wizard

first build downloads jocl and builds the CL parser/lexer, so don't worry if
you see compiler errors right after opening the project.
